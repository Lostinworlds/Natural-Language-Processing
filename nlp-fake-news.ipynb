    "# Introduction \n",
    "Fake news is defined as \"*false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke*.\" ([Cambridge University Press, 2022](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fake-news)) Originating as far back as the Roman era, it has existed for over two millennia. ([BBC, 2022](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zwcgn9q)). However, powered by the growth of the internet, it has gained significant prominence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its influence on the public is a course for concern as it \"*promotes toxic narratives, spreads doubt and confusion, and increases social polarisation, affecting democratic decision-making*.\" ([Civica, 2022](https://www.civica.eu/fake-news-and-democracy/)) It can also be difficult to identify due to cognitive biases. These are shortcuts and according to Centre for Information Technology & Society ([2022](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/why-we-fall)) four aspects of cognitive biases are in affect in the utility of information. \n",
    "> First, we tend to focus on headlines and tags without reading the article they’re associated with. Second, social media’s popularity signals affect our attention to and acceptance of information. Third, fake news takes advantage of partisanship, a very strong reflex. And fourth, persistence--there’s a weird tendency for false information to stick around, even after it’s corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of fake news made headlines during the 2016 US election ([Blake, 2018](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/03/a-new-study-suggests-fake-news-might-have-won-donald-trump-the-2016-election/)). However, due to its power to miniplate audiences and subsequent profitability, as well as the ethics surrounding free speech, fake news continues to be prominent. For instance,  Donald Trump's use of fake news to benefit himself and strengthen his position is widely recorded. ([Rattner, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/trump-tweets-legacy-of-lies-misinformation-distrust.html)) In such cases, securing government led condemnation of the issue may be limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that efforts have not been made. For instance, organisations such as [FactChecker](https://www.factcheck.org/about/our-mission/) and Birdwatch strived to debunk such news ([Lorenz et al, 2022](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/09/twitter-birdwatch-factcheck-musk-misinfo/)). They work by identifying and highlighting misinformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method is one of 4 methods highlighted in a report by Lazer et al ([2017](https://www.sipotra.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Combating-Fake-News.pdf)) as methods to combat fake news: \n",
    "> (1) offering feedback to users that particular news may be fake (which seems to depress overall sharing from those individuals); \n",
    "> (2) providing ideologically compatible sources that confirm that particular news is fake; (3) detecting information that is being promoted by bots and “cyborg” accounts and tuning algorithms to not respond to those manipulations; and \n",
    "> (4) because a few sources may be the origin of most fake news, identifying those sources and reducing promotion (by the platforms) of information from those sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combatting Fake News\n",
    "In the case of the methods highlighted above and in the ways exercised by groups such as FactCherker, fake news must first be identified. For this, fake news or suspected fake news needs to be identified and a key tool for such identification can be machine learning/ artificial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main methods for this. Unsupervised learning may be able to identify discussion groups where an Echo chamber is forming. Likewise, a supervised learning model akin to those used for spam filtering could be used to identify suspected fake news based on a pre-existing dataset. The later can be explored using a [fake news dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). \n",

    "# Further Concerns\n",
    "One major solution that individuals revert to is the notion that as the issues of fake news grows, individuals will become better adopt at identifying it and acting accordingly. However this entails training individuals to go against their default cognitive biases. In addition, whilst individuals may be aware that photoshop is frequently used in images, its impact on mental health remains profound. ([Harvard, 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/photoshops-damaging-effects/)) Moreover, educating a large population who are no longer in education can also be challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the issues covered only cover the information which is in the public domain. It does not cover the growing concerns surrounding echo chambers and private groups where fake news is able to freely circulate ([DW Documentary, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDtFpGfORpE&list=WL&index=5)). \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it is likely that the key tools to combat this issue lies in the development of AI and its utility on key social networking sites. Any short term gains made by fake news is unlike to be a product with long term value and a robust campaign to tackle it is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion \n",
    "Fake news is a major issue affecting society. This is unlikely to alter in the near future especially as technology such as deep fakes continue to develop ([Schwartz, 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth)).  Subsequently, there is a strong need to find robust methods to combat such information. In order to do so, there is a strong need to identify possible fake news so it may be investigated and appropriate action taken. For this, tools such as machine learning highlighted here may serve a vital role. "
